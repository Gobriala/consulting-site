# Anthony Gobrial — Portfolio & Consulting Site (Work in Progress)

🚧 **This site is currently in development.**

This repository contains my in-progress portfolio and consulting site. It demonstrates my approach to web delivery, UX structure, responsive layout, and deployment via GitHub Pages.

The live site currently displays a “Coming Soon” page while the full experience is being finalized.

This project reflects how I approach:
- Content structure and UX hierarchy  
- Responsive front-end layout  
- Modern deployment workflows  
- Professional presentation of digital work  

More updates coming soon.
