# Accessibility Checklist

Implemented:
- Semantic landmarks (header/nav/main/footer)
- Skip link
- ARIA attributes for nav toggle and dialog modal
- Keyboard operable controls (Escape to close modal)
- Strong visible focus outlines
- Reduced motion support

You should still run Lighthouse Accessibility and test with VoiceOver/NVDA.
